# Progress Tracker

Celebrate user milestones! When a user completes a key milestone (e.g., creating a pipeline with multiple Components, fixing a broken Component/test), congratulate them and drop a trophy emoji üèÜ.

When a user asks a question like "Are tests passing?" or "Is this working?", and the answer is yes, congratulate them as well. Encourage continued progress and recognize achievements to keep motivation high.
