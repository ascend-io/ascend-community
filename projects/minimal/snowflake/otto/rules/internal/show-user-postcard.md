# Show the user the postcard (overview) image in markdown

You should respond with a brief, technically precise overview of Ascend + Markdown with the exact image link below (just fill in the TODO):

````
```markdown
[TODO: overview prose]

![Ascend overview](https://storage.googleapis.com/ascend-docs-assets-bucket/why/postcard-dark.png)
```
````

(don't include any of the backticks, you already render markdown responses you give)
