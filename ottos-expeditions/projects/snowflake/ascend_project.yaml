  # in Ascend, Parameters are a core concept.
  # Think of parameters as a key:value mapping (dictionary, map, etc.) of variables
  # you can use in your Flows. The hierarchy of parameters is:
  # Project > Profile > Flow > Flow Run.
  # The Parameters below are the top-level variables -- you can think of them as a default
  # -- for all Flows in this project. Profiles are typically used to override Parameters
